# Tech Funding Analytics Dashboard
### Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive dashboard that analyzes funding activities among tech companies in the United States. With data from over 1,800 companies across 105 industry verticals.


### Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis is the "tech_fundings.csv", containing information about funding of companies in USD, included company region,vertical, etc



### Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase im using python for the preparation and performed the following tasks
- Checking the summary statistics and the data type of each column.
- Dropping irrelevant columns
- Changing the data types

### Dashboarding
My dashboard provides several key highlights like
- Total companies: Over 1,800 companies based on US region and across 105 industry verticals
- Total Funding: USD 114 billion invested across various tech sectors.
- Average Funding: Approximately USD 57 million per company.
- Top companies: Companies such as Databricks, Articulate, and Relativity Space, which operate in the fields of AI, Education, and B2B software, have become the top 3 companies with the most funding.
- Top Verticals: B2B Software, Cloud Computing, and Artificial Intelligence lead in number of companies.
- Funding Trends: Peak funding occurred in July and September, with over USD 14 billion raised each month.

### Data Analysis (Top companies by vertical)

Most of the tech companies in US operating in the B2B software sector, although the companies operating in that field are not too many for the average funding (only 43.62 millions),but the sector holds about 30 percent of the most significant sector. The total funding trend has shown a steady decline over time, following a peak of $85 million in February.


but based on my analysis, considering this sector makes up roughly 30% of all verticals. The B2B software sector has the potential to rebound in total funding, driven by possible innovations from companies, improving market conditions, and renewed investor interest. 

The recent decline may be attributed to:
1. Economic uncertainty
2. investor shifts toward other sectors such as AI, education, and aerospaceâ€”especially considering that the top three companies with the highest funding operate in those fields.
3. It may also result from a 'wait-and-see' phase caused by overvalued startups.

Once market conditions stabilize, this sector holds strong potential to attract significantly more investment compared to others.
